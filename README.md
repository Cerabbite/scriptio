# Why Scriptio?
I like writing and creating stories in my spare time. For the last few years I have been using plenty of online screenplay editors, each of them being more or less enjoyable. I wanted a free, simple, but pretty screenplay editor, Scriptio was born.

My biggest inspiration is by far *Amazon Story Writer*, a very handy free tool published by Amazon, which has unfortunately been shut down on June 30, 2019.
