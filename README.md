# Why Scriptio?

I like writing and creating stories in my spare time. For the last few years I have been using plenty of online screenplay editors such as _Celtx_, _WriterDuet_ or _KitScenarist_, each of these being more or less enjoyable. However, none of them met my criteria. I wanted a free, dead simple, but pretty screenplay editor.

My biggest inspiration is by far _Amazon Story Writer_, a very handy writing tool published by Amazon by 2015, which has unfortunately been shut down on June 30, 2019.
